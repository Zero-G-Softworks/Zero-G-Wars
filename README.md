## Milestones
### Alpha 1
Alpha 1 will introduce the basic game functionality. Bonuses do not need to be implemented yet. The UI does not need to be complete nor even exist, it can simply be playable from console. Users may be created via a direct database query. This will introduce the database structure, server project framework, client project framework, networking code, server implementation of the basic game, and basic model implementation of the client.

### Alpha 2
Alpha 2 will introduce the basic UI, for the base game (minus bonuses). The art does not need to be complete, however, placeholders need to be created during this time. The client implementation of the model will be completed at this time.

### Alpha 3
Alpha 3 will introduce the bonuses, they will be implemented client and server side.

### Alpha 4
Alpha 4 will introduce non-game functionality. This includes the leaderboard and account management modules.

### Alpha 5
Alpha 5 will improve the visuals. Real game art will be added, music and sound effects will be added.
